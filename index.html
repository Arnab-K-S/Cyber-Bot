        <div class="textbox">Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He has since been featured in films, television shows, novels, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues.In his origin story, Spider-Man gets superhuman spider-related powers and abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength, speed, and agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design. After the personal tragedy of his late Uncle Ben, Peter began using his spider-powers to fight against crime as Spider-Man. </div>
